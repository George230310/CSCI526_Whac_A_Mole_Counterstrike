  - 'Welcome to Whac A Mole: RPS'
  - In this game, instead of smashing moles, you will have to defeat them by winning
    rock paper scissor games
  - Now, let's get started with the tutorial
  - Your cursor represents your choice among rock, paper, and scissor
  - Your choice is default to rock, press the '2' key to switch to paper
  - Now you have switched to paper, press the '3' key to switch to scissor
  - Oops, a mole just spawned on the ground, and it chooses to challenge you with
    rock
  - Switch your choice to paper with '2', left click on the mole cube to defeat it
  - You can see on the left side of screen that your current score is increased by
    100
  - In the actual game, you need to make it to the target score within time limit
    to win the game (unlimited time right now)
  - Remember, rock beats scissor, scissor beats paper, paper beats rock
  - A win in rock paper scissor is +100, a tie is +0, and a lose is -50
  - Moles spawn randomly on the ground like this
  - Now, try to reach the target score to finish the tutorial!
